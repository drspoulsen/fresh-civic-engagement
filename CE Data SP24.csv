Civic engagement is individual and collective actions designed to identify and address issues of public concern and opportunities for positive change. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life of our communities--promoting the quality of life in a community through both political and non-political processes.

 

Some examples might include activism/advocacy, community service/volunteering, service-learning, philanthropy/fundraising, political engagement, civic learning, and community engaged research and internships.","When you think about civic engagement, what activities are central to your definition, or are most important?
